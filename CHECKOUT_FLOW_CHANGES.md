# Checkout Flow Changes

## Overview
Modified the checkout flow to ensure orders are only created after successful payment, not when the checkout page is accessed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Checkout Page (`app/checkout/page.tsx`)
- **Removed**: Order creation when component mounts
- **Modified**: Only creates payment intent, no order creation
- **Updated**: Order ID display shows "Will be generated after payment"
- **Removed**: `orderId` state variable and related logic

### 2. Payment Intent API (`app/api/payment-intent/route.ts`)
- **Modified**: Made `orderId` parameter optional in request body
- **Updated**: Logging to show when orderId is not provided

### 3. Stripe Webhook (`app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`)
- **Simplified**: Always creates new order after successful payment
- **Removed**: Complex logic for finding existing orders
- **Updated**: Creates order with `PAID` status directly

## Flow Summary

### Before (Old Flow)
1. User visits checkout page
2. Order created immediately in database with `PENDING` status
3. Payment intent created with order ID
4. After payment success, order status updated to `PAID`

### After (New Flow)
1. User visits checkout page
2. **No order created** - only payment intent created
3. After payment success via webhook, order created with `PAID` status

## Benefits
- No orphaned orders in database
- Cleaner data - only successful orders are stored
- Reduced database operations during checkout
- Better user experience - no premature order creation

## Testing
Use the test script `scripts/test-checkout-no-order-creation.mjs` to verify:
- No orders are created when accessing checkout
- Orders are only created after successful payment via webhook

## Database Impact
- Existing pending orders will remain in database
- New orders will only be created with final status (`PAID`, `FAILED`, or `CANCELLED`)
- No `PENDING` orders can be created anywhere in the system
- Prisma schema updated to remove default `PENDING` status
- No data migration required

## Additional Changes Made

### 4. Stripe Webhook (`app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`)
- **Updated**: Payment failure handling now creates `FAILED` orders directly
- **Removed**: Logic for finding and updating existing `PENDING` orders

### 5. Orders API (`app/api/orders/route.ts`)
- **Modified**: Now requires explicit status parameter (`PAID`, `FAILED`, or `CANCELLED`)
- **Removed**: Default `PENDING` status creation
- **Updated**: Transaction status mapping based on order status

### 6. Prisma Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- **Removed**: Default `PENDING` status from Order model
- **Updated**: Status field now requires explicit value

### 7. Dashboard Component (`components/dashboard/dashboard-content.tsx`)
- **Updated**: Pending orders count always returns 0 (no pending orders exist)

### 8. Test Scripts
- **Updated**: Sample order creation scripts to exclude `PENDING` status
